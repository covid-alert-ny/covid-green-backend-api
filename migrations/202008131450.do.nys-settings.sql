By downloading this COVID-19 NI Contact Tracing App you agree to these terms.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n============\\n\\nThese are the terms of use for the COVID-19 NI Contact Tracing App (also referred to as StopCOVD NI) which is being made available by the Department of Health (DoH) in Northern Ireland (under powers available through the 'Health and Social Care (Reform) Act (Northern Ireland) 2009'). The App has been designed to assist in stopping the spread of Covid-19 in Northern Ireland, by anonymously contacting people who have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. The App has been developed on behalf of the Department of Health and Health and Social Care organisations across Northern Ireland (HSCNI).\\n\\nThe phones of those who are using the App emit anonymised coded 'keys', 'Identifier Beacons', which change every 15 minutes. These 'keys' are stored on the user's phone for 14 days before being discarded. When close to each other, App users' phones exchange these anonymous 'keys', and if they are in close proximity with another user for a significant period of time, both will store the anonymous 'key' of the other phone for 14 days.\\n\\n'Authorisation Codes' are anonymous random six digit alphanumeric codes generated to verify that a positive test has been received by the App user, allowing 'exposure notifications' to be sent via the App, when the user enters a valid 'authorisation code.' On entering the code, the user is asked to release the anonymous keys their phone has transmitted over the previous 14 days: these are then known as 'diagnosis keys'. These are then released to the secure registry supporting users of the App, to\\nbe shared with other App users.\\n\\n'Diagnosis keys' are anonymised identifiers generated on entry of an 'authorisation code' on the App, and stored in a secure registry, maintained in a Health & Social Care Board secure cloud services account\\n(on behalf of the DoH) on Amazon Web Services (based in London). Every App user's phone regularly checks for 'diagnosis keys' and where these match a significant contact episode's anonymous 'key' stored on their phone, over the previous 14 days, an 'exposure notification' is enabled. The notification is generated on the App user's phone, not in the secure registry.\\n\\nWhere 'Exposure Notification' is mentioned, this refers to an anonymous notification received, via the App, that you have been in contact with an unnamed individual who has tested positive for COVID-19, and that contact was recent enough, and for sufficient time, at a close enough distance to mean that you may have been infected.\\n\\nPlease read these terms of use in conjunction with the Privacy Information Notice for the App, available to view below.\\n\\nReferences to DoH in these terms of use are Department of Health NI which is the owner and licensor of the StopCOVID NI Contact Tracing App. References to the user refer to the person who has downloaded the App onto their device for their own personal use and who uses the service.\\n\\nWhat the StopCOVID NI Contact Tracing App does\\n==============================================\\n\\nThe StopCOVID NI Contact Tracing App only provides one function, namely 'exposure notification'. It is a clearly declared position that no further functions will be added to this App, and that use of GPS location functionality will **NOT** be added at any time by the DoH.\\n\\nExposure Notification\\n---------------------\\n\\nThe App records if users are in close contact with another App user (see above). If an App user tests positive for COVID-19 the App will notify any App users that have been closer than two metres for more than fifteen minutes (this is in line with current public health policy, and can be changed depending on advised best practice), in the previous 14 days. The App uses capabilities of mobile operating systems. Apple and Google have developed a method that allows specific government-only COVID-19 Apps to make use of Bluetooth technology on phones that would otherwise not be available. As the App will need to use the most current version of the phone's operating system, users may be asked to upgrade the first time they use it. None of the information in this App is ever shared with Apple or Google. The App cannot be used on older phones, on which it is not possible to upgrade the operating system. It is not available on phones which use a different operating system, other than the Android or iOS systems deployed by Google / Apple.\\n\\nFirst time use\\n--------------\\n\\nThe first time anyone uses the App they are prompted to allow the App to collect and share the anonymous data transmitted by nearby devices that also have the App installed.\\n\\nMetrics Data\\n------------\\n\\nMetric data does not identify you and is used to create aggregate views of how the App is being used and the impact it is having on the virus. Here is a list of the App metrics which, if you consent, are collected from your App.\\n\\n1.  The number of App users\\n\\n2.  Ratio of exposure notifications to positive cases, measured at a regional level (not related to any individual user). The DoH will not know who, where or when, simply total numbers of 'authorisation codes' and 'exposure notifications' in any given time period.\\n\\nNo personally identifiable information is entered on the App. The 'App settings' gives you the ability to remove the App at any time, and any information stored on the phone while using the App.\\n\\nIf you are notified that you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive, you will be advised to self isolate for 14 days. If you have symptoms you will directed to check your symptoms at\\n<https://covid-19.hscni.net/> (where you can download the 'COVIDcare NI' symptom checker App if you do not already have it) and book a test. \\n\\nUse of the StopCOVID NI Contact Tracing App.\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe StopCOVID NI Contact Tracing App is free to download and use to anyone who is resident in Northern Ireland. The Service is intended only for people resident in Northern Ireland and the Service may not be\\notherwise used. Users downloading the App who are not resident in Northern Ireland will not be able to receive authorisation codes, in relation to a positive test for COVID-19, as the app is linked to the NI\\ntest registry, (which only receives results in relation to people resident in Northern Ireland). On downloading and activating the App, users are asked to confirm that they are resident in Northern Ireland, and if not, are discouraged from using the App, explaining that it will not work for them. They are encouraged to use an App intended to cover their own area.\\n\\nIt is intended that the StopCOVID NI Contact Tracing App will be able to be used by those resident in Northern Ireland visiting anywhere in the Republic of Ireland; and it is intended that those using the App\\nlaunched in the Republic of Ireland, may use that App visiting Northern Ireland. This will be achieved by delivering 'interoperability'. 'Interoperability' is achieved by the secure sharing of anonymous\\n'diagnosis keys' on a secure shared server. This is regulated by GDPR legislation, (and a bilateral agreement between the Departments of Health in both countries,) and is not accessible by any other means\\nother than the Apps of the two countries. It is intended that as other countries release similar Apps, more agreements will be reached to share anonymous 'diagnosis keys', enabling users of the StopCOVID NI app to use the app visiting other countries. These 'keys' cannot be used to identify any individual, and are totally anonymous. The ability for App users who travel to be able to receive notifications, and enable others to receive notifications if they test positive is important to help stop\\nspread of COVID as people start to travel again.\\n\\nUse of the App requires an Android or iPhone mobile telephone device which supports Android 6.0 or higher (in the case of Android phones) or iOS 13.5 or later (in the case of iPhones). In addition, in order to\\noperate correctly, the App also requires Bluetooth functionally turned on and the COVID Exposure Notification service enabled.\\n\\nIf you consent to the Exposure Notification service provided by the App and want to receive those services, you will need to enable Bluetooth and location services and you will need to permit push notifications from the App. The App will prompt you about enabling these services and providing permissions if and when you give your consent to receive theservice from the App. The App does not use GPS location services, or Google location services to track your movements. The App simply uses\\nthe strength of the Bluetooth signal of phones, with the App activated, to measure the proximity of those phones, and the length of time spent at a given proximity.\\n\\nMore about the DoH and the licence to use the App\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWe, the Department of Health (DoH) in Northern Ireland, and on behalf of the Department of Health and Health and Social Care organisations across Northern Ireland (HSCNI), license you to use:\\n\\nThe Covid-19 Contact Tracing mobile application software and the data supplied with the software (the StopCOVID NI Contact Tracing App) and any authorised updates or supplements to it,\\n\\nThe related online or electronic documentation related to the App (Documentation), and The Services you connect to via the App and the content we provide to you through it, as outlined above, subject to and\\nas permitted in these terms.\\n\\nThe above licence is a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, limited licence to use the StopCOVID NI Contact Tracing App and the Documentation, and through the App to use the Services, for your\\nown personal use. All other licence rights not expressly permitted are fully reserved to us.\\n\\nIf you want to report back to us about your experience with using the StopCOVID NI Contact Tracing App, or want to report any problems with the use of the App or the Services, please contact us by calling the\\nNorthern Ireland' Helpline '**111**' and selecting the option to speak to someone to log a request, at the following times; Monday-Friday (excluding bank holidays) between the hours of 830am -- 530 pm. You will also find more information at\\n[[https://covid-19.hscni.net/]{.ul}](https://covid-19.hscni.net/)\\n\\nYour Privacy\\n------------\\n\\nWe only use any data we collect through your use of the App and the Services in the ways set out in our Privacy Information Notice (link to dedicated website). The Privacy Information Notice confirms the terms\\nupon which your data is collected and used in respect of your use of the App and the Services.\\n\\nApp Store's terms also apply\\n----------------------------\\n\\nWhen you download the App, or when you access or use the App or the Services, you may also be subject to the terms of use and policies of the relevant App Store (Google Play Store or Apple Store) from which you\\ndownload the App. Please review these terms of use and policies very carefully. Your access to, and use of the Services, will be governed by these (the DoH's) terms of use, unless the terms of use and policies of the relevant App Store say otherwise.\\n\\nHow you may use the App, including how many devices you may use it on\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn return for your agreeing to comply with these terms you may:\\n\\n-   download a copy of the App onto one mobile device and view, use and display the App and the Services on this device for your personal purposes only,\\n\\n-   use any Documentation to support your permitted use of the App and the Services,\\n\\n-   provided you comply with the licence restrictions above, make one copy of the App and the Documentation for back-up purposes, and\\n\\n-   receive and use any free supplementary software code or update of the App incorporating \\\"patches\\\" and corrections of errors as we may provide to you.\\n\\nYou must be 18 to accept these terms and to download and use the App\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYou must be at least 18 years of age in order to accept these terms and to download and use the App.\\n\\nThe right to use the App and Services is personal and you may not transfer the App to someone else\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWe are giving you personally the right to use the App and the Services as set out above LINK TO 'HOW YOU MAY USE THE APP.' The use of the App by multiple individuals from the same device undermines the accuracy and efficacy or the App's contact tracing function (if enabled). If you permit someone else to access your device and to use the App or Services, then you do so at your own risk, and you are responsible for\\nthat person's use and you must ensure that the person knows about and complies with these terms. You must also not use any other person's StopCOVID NI Contact Tracing App.\\n\\nYou may not otherwise transfer the App or the Services to someone else, whether for money, for anything else or for free. If you sell any device on which the App is installed, you must first remove the App from the device.\\n\\nChanges to these terms\\n----------------------\\n\\nWe may need to change these terms to reflect changes in law or best practice or to deal with additional features which we introduce.\\n\\nWe will give you at least 7 days' notice of any change by sending you an in-App notification and providing you with details of the change, on this publication, and notifying you of a change when you next start the App.\\n\\nChanges driven\\n--------------\\n\\nNorthern Ireland Public health policy may not be subject to the 7 days' notice, as the timing of implementation may not allow it. DoH will publicly notify changes in the app and on (link to dedicated website) in advance.\\n\\nIf you do not accept the notified changes, we will advise you what specifically this will mean at the date of the notification. It may mean that you will not be permitted to continue to use the App and the\\nServices. This will be your informed choice.\\n\\nUpdates to the App and changes to the Services\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nFrom time to time we may automatically update the App and change the Service settings to improve performance, enhance functionality, reflect changes to the operating system or address security issues.\\nAlternatively, we may ask you to update the App for these reasons. If you choose not to install such updates or if you opt out of automatic updates you may not be able to continue using the App and the Service, and you may compromise the security of your data or device.\\n\\nIf someone else owns the phone or device you are using\\n------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIf you download or stream the App onto any phone or other device not owned by you, you must have the owner's permission to do so. You will be responsible for complying with these terms, whether or not you own the phone or other device.\\n\\nWe are not responsible for other websites you link to\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe App or any Service may contain links to other independent websites which are not provided by us. Such independent sites are not under our control, and we are not responsible for and have not checked and\\napproved their content or their privacy policies (if any). You will need to make your own independent judgement about whether to use any such independent sites.\\n\\nLicence restrictions\\n--------------------\\n\\nYou agree that you will:\\n\\n-   except in the course of permitted sharing, see information on how you may use the app above, not rent, lease, sub-license, loan, provide, or otherwise make available, the App or the Service in any form, in whole or in part to any person without prior written consent from us, nor will you infringe our rights (including ourintellectual property rights) in relation to your use of the App or Services;\\n\\n-   not copy the App, Documentation or Services, except as part of the normal use of the App or where it is necessary for the purpose of back-up or operational security,\\n\\n-   not translate, merge, adapt, vary, alter or modify, the whole or any part of the App, Documentation or Services nor permit the App or the Services or any part of them to be combined with, or become incorporated in, any other programs, except as necessary to use the App and the Services on devices as permitted in these terms,\\n\\n-   not disassemble, de-compile, reverse engineer or create derivative works based on the whole or any part of the App or the Services nor attempt to do any such things, except to the extent that (by virtue\\nof 'The Copyright (Computer Programs) Regulations 1992') such actions cannot be prohibited because they are necessary to decompile the App to obtain the information necessary to create an independent program that can be operated with the App or with another program (Permitted Objective), and provided that the information obtained by you during such activities:\\n\\n-   is not disclosed or communicated without the DoH's prior written consent to any third party to whom it is not necessary to disclose or communicate it in order to achieve the Permitted Objective,\\n\\n-   is not used to create any software that is substantially similar in its expression to the App,\\n\\n-   is kept secure; and\\n\\n-   is used only for the Permitted Objective,\\n\\n-   comply with all applicable technology control or export laws and regulations that apply to the technology used or supported by the App or any Services.\\n\\nYou must:\\n\\n-   ensure that all information that you provide to us via the App is accurate, complete, honest and not misleading, to the best of your knowledge, information and belief,\\n\\n-   comply with all applicable laws and regulations in using the App and the Services,\\n\\n-   not use the App or any Service in any unlawful manner, for any unlawful purpose, or in any manner inconsistent with these terms, or act fraudulently or maliciously, for example, by hacking into or inserting malicious code, such as viruses, or harmful data, into the App, any Service or any operating system;\\n\\n-   not infringe our intellectual property rights or those of any third party in relation to your use of the App or any Service, including by the submission of any material (to the extent that such use is not licensed by these terms);\\n\\n-   not transmit any material that is defamatory, offensive or otherwise objectionable in relation to your use of the App or any Service;\\n\\n-   not use the App or any Service in a way that could damage, disable, overburden, impair or compromise our systems or security or interfere with other users; and\\n\\n-   not collect or harvest any information or data from any Service or our systems or attempt to decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running any Service.\\n\\nIntellectual property rights\\n----------------------------\\n\\nAll intellectual property rights in the App, the Documentation and the Services throughout the world belong to us or our licensors and the rights in the App and the Services are licensed (not sold) to you. You have no intellectual property rights in, or to, the App, the Documentation or the Services other than the right to use them in accordance with these terms.\\n\\nOur responsibility to you\\n-------------------------\\n\\n**No warranty.** While the DoH takes every care to ensure the correctness of the information, content and communications published in the app, it makes no representation, warranty or guarantee as to the\\ncorrectness, accuracy, completeness, currency or reliability thereof. The DoH assumes no responsibility and makes no warranty that the functions and use of the App will be permanently and continuously\\navailable and free of errors or faults, that errors will be rectified, or that the App will be free of viruses or other harmful elements.\\n\\n**Exclusion of liability.** To the extent permitted by law, any claims\\nfor liability against the DoH due to material or immaterial damage,\\nincluding indirect or consequential damage, arising for example from\\naccess to, use or non-use of the App and the associated information,\\ncontent and communications, from misuse of the connection or technical\\nfaults or any other loss or damage whether arising under tort (including\\nnegligence), breach of contract, breach of statutory duty or otherwise,\\nare hereby excluded.\\n\\n**We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so**. This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our\\nemployees, agents or subcontractors or for fraud or fraudulent\\nmisrepresentation, or in respect of any of your legal rights as a\\nconsumer (to the extent that these cannot be excluded).\\n\\n**Limitations to the App and the Services**. While the App provides\\nnotification to those who may have been exposed to a confirmed positive\\ncase, providing advice to self-isolate. The App provides no additional\\nfunctions. All those in Northern Ireland with a positive test result,\\nfor COVID-19, would be expected to receive a phone call from a clinical\\nprofessional employed on the Test Trace and Protect programme. This\\npublic health service, provided in Northern Ireland, is separate from\\nthe App and works in parallel. The App works in an anonymous and\\nautomated way, in parallel to the manual Test Trace and Protect contact\\ntracing process. Information from the app is not shared with those\\nworking in the manual service.\\n\\n**Automated processing.** The generation of exposure notices on the app is an automated process, not involving a human. The automated process is carried out by use of anonymous identification keys, and measurement of Bluetooth signals to calculate that App users' phones have been close enough for long enough to constitute a significant contact, sufficient to put you at risk of having been infected. It is necessary for the app to do this in an automated way, in order to protect your identity and the identity of other app users. In accepting terms and conditions you are consenting to this process. If you need to discuss this with an individual, you can call the Northern Ireland' Helpline '**111**' Monday-Friday (excluding bank holidays) between the hours of 830am -- 530 pm. Select the option to discuss the 'StopCOVID NI' Proximity App.\\n\\n**Withdrawal of or changes to the App or Services.** The App and Services are intended to be made available for a limited period only while the Covid-19 crisis is ongoing. Without prejudice to this the DoH expressly reserves the right, at any time, without prior notice, to withdraw the App and Services. The DoH also expressly reserves the right, at any time, and without prior notice, to make changes and/or\\nimprovements to the App and Services.\\n\\n**Please back-up content and data used with the App.** We recommend that you back up any content and data used in connection with the App, to protect yourself in case of problems with the App or the Service.\\n\\n**Check that the App and the Services are suitable for you.** The App and the Services have not been developed to meet your individual requirements. Please check that the facilities and functions of the App\\nand the Services (as described on the App Store site and in the Documentation) meet your requirements.\\n\\n**We are not responsible for events outside our control.** If our provision of the Services or support for the App or the Services is delayed by an event outside our control then we will contact you as soon\\nas possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. Provided we do this we will not be liable for delays caused by the event but if there is a risk of substantial delay\\nyou may contact us to end your contract with us and receive a refund for any Services you have paid for but not received.\\n\\nYou can end your use of the App and what happens if you do\\n----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYou can stop using the App at any time, and you can delete it at any time from your device.\\n\\nIf you delete the App, you will not be able to access the Services, and all rights granted to you by these terms will cease. We will not be holding any personal in relation to you, since we will not be collecting any; however any data held on your phone can be removed as indicated in the App instructions. Details are provided in relation to data processed by the App in the Privacy Information Notice on (link to dedicated website).\\n\\nWe may end your rights to use the App and the Services if you break these terms\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWe may end your rights to use the App and Services at any time by contacting you if you have broken these terms in a serious way. If what you have done can be remedied we will give you a reasonable opportunity\\nto do so.\\n\\nIf we end your rights to use the App and Services:\\n\\n- You must stop all activities authorised by these terms, including your use of the App and any Services.\\n\\n- You must delete or remove the App from your device(s) and immediately destroy all copies of the App which you have and confirm to us that you have done this.\\n\\n- We may remotely access your device(s) and remove the App from it/them and cease providing you with access to the Services.\\n\\nWe may transfer our rights and obligations to someone else\\n----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWe may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms to another organisation. We will always tell you in writing if this happens and we will ensure that the transfer will not affect your rights under the contract\\n\\nYou need our consent to transfer your rights to someone else\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYou may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these terms to another person if we agree in writing.\\n\\nNo rights for third parties\\n---------------------------\\n\\nIn respect of any individual not resident in Northern Ireland, downloading and using the App: it is clearly our stated intent that this app should **not be used by individual who is not resident in Northern Ireland**. In order to avail of the App's functionality in terms of exposure notification, it is essential that users are resident in Norther Ireland, in order for us to be able to deliver authorisation codes in relation to their test results. During the on-boarding process, App users are given clear instruction not to use the App if they are not resident in Northern Ireland, and that the App functionality will not be available to them. As a result, we can accept no liability for anyone\\nignoring the instruction and using the App improperly.\\n\\nIf a court finds part of these terms illegal, the rest will continue in force\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nEach of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.\\n\\nEven if we delay in enforcing these terms, we can still enforce them later\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nEven if we delay in enforcing these terms, we can still enforce them later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking these terms, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.\\n\\nTerms survive\\n-------------\\n\\nAny of these terms of use that are intended to come into or continue in force on or after termination or expiry of these terms (which includes for the avoidance of doubt the provisions dealing with *Our responsibility to you*) will remain in full force and effect following termination or expiry. Termination or expiry of these terms of use shall not affect any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities of you or us that have accrued up to the date of termination or expiry, including the\\nright to claim damages in respect of any breach of the terms of use which existed at or before the date of termination or expiry.\\n\\nWhich laws apply to these terms and where you can bring legal proceedings\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThese terms are governed by the law in Northern Ireland and you can bring legal proceedings in respect of these terms (or anything to do with the App or the Services) in the courts in Northern Ireland only.\\n\\nPrivacy Information\\n\\n**Data Controller Contact Details**\\n\\nDepartment of Health (DoH)Castle BuildingsStormontBelfastBT4 3SG\\n\\nContact- Chief Digital Information Officer Group\\n\\n<CDIO@health-ni.gov.uk>\\n\\n**Data Protection Officer**\\n\\nCharlene McQuillan\\n\\n<DPO@health-ni.gov.uk>\\n\\nIntroduction\\n============\\n\\nThe purpose of this information notice is to explain how the StopCOVID NI Contact Tracing App works, what data is collected by the app, who as access to that data and the purposes for which they use it.\\n\\nUse of the app is entirely voluntary and is available to download for free from the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. The app runs on iPhones that support iOS 13.5 and higher, and Android phones running Android 6.0 and higher. The App is not intended for use by persons under 18 years of age, as they are considered not to have reached the digital age of consent. You will be asked to confirm that you are 18 years or older after you download the App.\\n\\nThe Data Controllers\\n====================\\n\\nThe Department of Health (DoH) in Northern Ireland is the Data Controller - they have decided the means and purposes for the processing of data (which includes special categories of personal data) using the\\napp. The DoH has commissioned all app related systems processing all data. The DoH provides strategic direction for the app.\\n\\nThe DoH is therefore responsible for your personal data and has determined its responsibilities for compliance with its obligations under data protection laws. The DoH have provided access to speak to\\nsomeone via the '111' Northern Ireland' Helpline, Monday-Friday (excluding bank holidays) between the hours of 830am -- 530 pm, should you wish to raise and issue in relation to how your data is managed by\\nthe App, though note that you also have the right to contact the DoH in this regard.\\n\\nWhat the app does\\n=================\\n\\nThe app has the purpose of supporting the national public health response and members of the public during the COVID-19 crisis. The app has the following functions.\\n\\n1.  Exposure Notification -- the App, through use of anonymous 'keys' records when App users' phones have been in proximity to each other, for a sufficient period of time to mean that it is possible that the infection has been passed on. Should an App user test positive for COVID-19, it is possible for them to alert other App users anonymously via the functions supported by the App.\\n\\n2.  Registering a Positive Test Result -- App users who have a positive test for COVID-19 will receive a randomly generated 'authorisation code' via SMS text message. This process is managed via a separate test registry, administered by the Business Services Organisation (in accordance with its statutory function, as defined in the 'Health and Social Care (Reform) Act (Northern Ireland) 2009'). This is separate from the App, in order to keep personal and identifiable information separate from the APP.\\n\\n3.  Other Functions -- the app will collect Metric data does not identify you and is used to create aggregate views of how the App is being used and the impact it is having on the virus. Here is a list of the App metrics which, if you consent, are collected from your\\n    App:\\n\\n    a.  The number of App users\\n\\n    b.  Ratio of exposure notifications to positive cases, measured at a regional level (not related to any individual user). The DoH will not know who, where or when, simply total numbers of 'authorisation codes' and 'exposure notifications' in any given time period.\\n\\nNo personally identifiable information is entered on the App. The 'App\\nsettings' gives you the ability to remove the App at any time, and any\\ninformation stored on the phone while using the App. The information\\ncollected is essential in allowing the App to meet its obligations for\\nformal approval as a medical device and CE accreditation; in line with\\nrequirements published by the Regulator, MHRA. Your explicit consent is\\nobtained during the on-boarding process. It is not possible for you to\\nuse the App if you do not agree to this data being collected. Collection\\nof the data is essential for the DoH meet its regulated obligations in\\nrelation to registration of the device, and to allow the DoH to support\\nthe essential public health function of contact tracing in delivering\\ninfection control measures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nThe phones of those who are using the App emit anonymised coded 'keys',\\n'Identifier Beacons', which change every 15 minutes. These 'keys' are\\nstored on the user's phone for 14 days before being discarded. When\\nclose to each other, App users' phones exchange these anonymous 'keys',\\nand if they are in close proximity with another user for a significant\\nperiod of time, both will store the anonymous 'key' of the other phone\\nfor 14 days.\\n\\n'Authorisation Codes' are anonymous random six digit alphanumeric codes\\ngenerated to verify that a positive test has been received by the App\\nuser, allowing 'exposure notifications' to be sent via the App, when the\\nuser enters a valid 'authorisation code.' On entering the code, the user\\nis asked to release the anonymous keys their phone has transmitted over\\nthe previous 14 days: these are then known as 'diagnosis keys'. These\\nare then released to the secure registry supporting users of the App, to\\nbe shared with other App users.\\n\\n'Diagnosis keys' are anonymised identifiers generated on entry of an\\n'authorisation code' on the App, and stored in a secure registry,\\nmaintained in a Health & Social Care Board secure cloud services account\\n(on behalf of the DoH) on Amazon Web Services (based in London). Every\\nApp user's phone regularly checks for 'diagnosis keys' and where these\\nmatch a significant contact episode's anonymous 'key' stored on their\\nphone, over the previous 14 days, an 'exposure notification' is enabled.\\nThe notification is generated on the App user's phone, not in the secure\\nregistry.\\n\\nWhere 'Exposure Notification' is mentioned, this refers to an anonymous\\nnotification received, via the App, that you have been in contact with\\nan unnamed individual who has tested positive for COVID-19, and that\\ncontact was recent enough, and for sufficient time, at a close enough\\ndistance to mean that you may have been infected.\\n\\n**The DoH is content to give a firm assurance that it has no future\\nintention to add to the functions of the StopCOVID NI App, beyond those\\nidentified above.** Future releases of the App may occur to improve the\\nperformance of existing functions, or to implement improvements in the\\nGoogle-Apple operating system that may occur to improve performance,\\nwithin the scope of existing functions (outlined above). The DoH is\\nconsidering the future development of versions of the same App, to\\naddress accessibility in terms of languages other than English. This\\ndecision will be balanced against public health benefit, and cost\\n(balanced against other health priorities).\\n\\nHow the app works\\n=================\\n\\nLet's look at each feature in the app in detail.\\n\\nHow Contact Tracing works\\n-------------------------\\n\\nExisting manual contact tracing processes rely on you being able to\\nremember who you have been in contact with recently, and for how long.\\nIn many cases you may not even know those people (for example, if the\\ncontact happened on a bus or train, at a concert, a restaurant or some\\nother public venue).\\n\\nThe app uses technology developed by Apple and Google where anonymous\\nrolling identifiers are exchanged between mobile phones. A random and\\nunique identifier is generated by your phone every 15 minutes (range -\\n10 to 20 minutes). If you are close to someone, who also uses the app on\\ntheir phone, your identifier will be saved on that person's phone and\\nyou will record their identifier on your phone. All identifiers\\ncollected will remain on your mobile but you can't see them, nor can\\nanyone else. These anonymous identifiers cannot identify you, to other\\nusers, or to the DoH.\\n\\nIf a person using the App subsequently receives a positive COVID-19\\ndiagnosis, they will receive a text message containing an 'authorisation\\ncode' via SMS. The Business Services Organisation test registry\\ngenerates a test notification to all those who have a registered mobile\\nphone number on their records, or who have registered for testing via\\nthe website <https://www.nhs.uk/ask-for-a-coronavirus-test>. The\\nBusiness Services Organisation does not know who is using the App, so\\nnotifications are sent to in relation to all positive tests. All those\\nwith a positive test will also receive a phone call from a clinical\\nprofessional as part of the 'Test Trace and Protect' programme,\\nadministered by the Public Health Agency (PHA) under powers available\\nthrough the 'Health and Social Care (Reform) Act (Northern Ireland)\\n2009'. The On the call, they will be asked if they are using the\\nStopCOVID NI Contact Tracing App and if yes, if they have not already\\ndone so, if they wish to enter an 'authorisation code' to the app to\\nenable the upload of 'diagnosis keys' from their phone. To do this, the\\nPHA will send them a code by SMS, which when entered into the app\\nunlocks an upload function. The person makes a choice to upload\\n'authorisation code' and release 'diagnosis keys' relating to the\\nanonymised identifiers of significant contacts processed on their own\\nphone, to a secure registry maintained in a Health & Social Care Board\\nsecure cloud services account (on behalf of the DoH) on Amazon Web\\nServices based in London; where the 'diagnosis key' identifiers are\\npublished to be visible to other App users phones, enabling 'Exposure\\nNotifications'. The SMS text message is delivered using the Gov.UK\\nNotify service <https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/> .\\n\\nEvery two hours, the latest 'Diagnosis Keys' from the App Registry will\\nbe downloaded by every user's phone. These will be used to check for\\nmatches against the identifiers of the contacts that have been collected\\nby your phone. If there is a match, you will be notified in the app that\\nyou were in close contact with a person who was diagnosed with COVID-19,\\nthis is called an 'Exposure Notification'.\\n\\nFor all this to work, you have to allow 'COVID-19 Exposure Notification\\nServices' on your phone. You can also choose to allow your phone to\\ndisplay notifications so that you also receive an alert on your phone\\nthat you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for\\nCOVID-19. You can turn off this functionality, if you change your mind,\\nin the settings page of the app.\\n\\nIt is important to note that Contact Tracing never reveals the identity\\nof any person using the app to other app users, and never reveals who\\nhas been diagnosed positive. Also, the PHA and DoH will not know if you\\nreceive an 'exposure notification'.\\n\\nWhat App metrics are collected\\n------------------------------\\n\\n1. Collected regionally\\n\\nThe app will collect Metric data does not identify you and is used to\\ncreate aggregate views of how the App is being used and the impact it is\\nhaving on the virus. Here is a list of the App metrics which, if you\\nconsent, are collected from your App:\\n\\na.  The number of App users\\n\\nb.  Ratio of exposure notifications to positive cases, measured at a\\n    regional level (not related to any individual user). The DoH will\\n    not know who, where or when, simply total numbers of 'authorisation\\n    codes' and 'exposure notifications' in any given time period.\\n\\n### 2. Generated by services on the phone\\n\\nThe following data is generated by Exposure Notification Services\\nrunning on your phone if you turn it on.\\n\\n1.  Identifiers sent and received between phones that have ENS turned\\n    on.\\n\\n2.  Identifiers (diagnosis keys) uploaded to the Health & Social Care\\n    Board (HSCB) secure cloud services account (on behalf of the DoH) on\\n    Amazon Web Services (based in London) (AWS) Registry if you are\\n    COVID-19 positive and you agree to upload them.\\n\\n3.  Identifiers (diagnosis keys) downloaded from the AWS Registry to\\n    your phone for matching.\\n\\nThe above identifiers are pseudo random alpha numeric values that cannot\\nbe used to identify you or anyone else. These are generated, collected\\nand matched on your phone if you enable ENS.\\n\\n### 3. Automatically collected from your phone:\\n\\nAs a consequence of how traffic passes across the Internet, your\\ninternet protocol (IP) address is also inevitably transferred to our\\nservers. An IP address is typically made up of 4 sets of numbers (e.g.\\n1.2.3.4) and is assigned to you by your mobile phone or Wi-Fi service\\nprovider. Under the GDPR your IP address is regarded as your personal\\ndata.\\n\\nWhile your data travels with the IP address it is considered personal\\ndata. The DoH does not use your IP address to identify you; furthermore\\nthe IP address is removed at the 'font door' of the HSCB AWS account,\\nand the information becomes anonymous again and cannot be linked back to\\nyou.\\n\\nThe legal basis for data processing\\n===================================\\n\\nThe legal basis for the data processing is The Health and Social Care\\n(Reform) Act (Northern Ireland) 2009,\\n\\n-   Section 2(1) the duty to promote in Northern Ireland an integrated\\n    system of health care designed to secure improvement in the physical\\n    and mental health of people in Northern Ireland and in the\\n    prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness, and\\n\\n-   Section 2(3)(g) the duty to secure the commissioning and development\\n    of programmes and initiatives conducive to the improvement of the\\n    health and social well-being of people in Northern Ireland, and\\n\\n-   Section 3(1)(b) the power to provide, or secure provision of, such\\n    health and social care as it considers appropriate for the purpose\\n    of discharging its duty under section 2; and do anything which is\\n    calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the\\n    discharge of that duty.\\n\\nThe app is voluntary to use and the legal basis for the processing of\\nthe data is 'consent', and 'processing is necessary for the performance\\nof a task carried out in the public interest' -- namely GDPR 6.1.a,\\n6.1.e, GDPR 9.2.a.and 9.2.i.\\n\\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Protection\\nAct 2018 together form a new framework for regulating the processing of\\npersonal data in the UK from 25^th^ May 2018, replacing the former Data\\nProtection Act 1998.\\n\\nSecurity measures\\n-----------------\\n\\nAll data stored on your phone is encrypted by the app using the built-in\\nencryption capability of your phone. Data is also encrypted when it is\\nbeing uploaded to our servers. The App does not store or transmit\\nidentifiable information. The App **does not access** GPS functionality\\non the phone, or access any form of location data from the operating\\nsystem.\\n\\nThe Contact Tracing feature uses a **fully decentralised** privacy model\\nwhich means that the matching of identifiers and diagnosis keys happens\\non your phone and is not externally performed by the DoH. This ensures\\nno tracking of peoples' movements or knowledge of who or when App users\\nhave been in contact with each other.\\n\\nThere are a range of security processes and technologies in place to\\nprevent unauthorised access to the data while it is stored on our\\nservers, including data encryption, modern firewalls and intrusion\\nprevention.\\n\\nWhen 'Diagnosis Keys' are uploaded to AWS servers with your IP address,\\nthe IP address is stripped from the information at the earliest possible\\nopportunity which renders the information anonymous.\\n\\nWho processes your data\\n-----------------------\\n\\nThe DoH is responsible for directing the operation of the app, and the\\nentire infrastructure required to operate and maintain the app and\\nbackend servers.\\n\\nData processors\\n---------------\\n\\nThere are a number of data processors who provide services to the app,\\nfor the DoH, and will have access to data. These are as follows:\\n\\n-   NearForm are the app developers who will be providing technical\\n    support on the running of the app.\\n\\n-   Big Motive are the design team who have worked with Nearform to\\n    design the user experience and content for the app.\\n\\n-   The DoH has purchased a service from Gov.UK Notify to enable the\\n    sending of an SMS to your phone which contains the 'Authorisation\\n    Code' needed to enable your phone to release 'Diagnosis Keys'\\n\\n-   Amazon Web Services provide cloud storage and cloud services for the\\n    data uploaded from your phone.\\n\\n-   The BSO operates the test registry, gathering the results of\\n    testing, positive test results to be notified via SMS text message,\\n    and be made available to PHA staff delivering manual contact tracing\\n    services, as well as associating results with electronic patient\\n    records to ensure appropriate access by clinical professionals\\n    supporting clinical care service delivery.\\n\\nContracts are in place with these third-party processors which set out\\nthe processor's obligations and the data controllers obligations and\\nrights with regard to the personal data that is being processed. All\\ndata processing takes place within the EEA area, and as such is subject\\nto legislation in the form of the General Data Protection Regulation\\n(GDPR).\\n\\nOther recipients\\n----------------\\n\\nThe regional level data (outlined above) is extremely limited in scope.\\nThe DoH will make freely available the high level data, in order for\\nmembers of the public to see the level of uptake, and the potential of\\nthe App to\\n\\nData transferred outside the European Economic Area\\n---------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNo data will be transferred outside the EEA. All data processing will be\\nsubject to GDPR regulations and obligations.\\n\\nHow long your personal data is held for\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nNo personal data is collected or stored.\\n\\nYour IP Address:\\n----------------\\n\\nFollowing upload of your IP address to AWS servers, it is deleted once\\nthe server network layer has routed the traffic to the application\\nlayer. User IP addresses are never transferred to the application layer.\\n\\n'Identifier beacons' on your device:\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nThis anonymous information is retained for 14 days.\\n\\nDiagnosis keys in AWS registry (HSCB account set up on behalf of the DoH):\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis anonymous information is retained for 14 days.\\n\\nDiagnosis keys on your device:\\n------------------------------\\n\\nThis anonymous information is retained for as long as is necessary to\\nperform a match check and is deleted thereafter.\\n\\nGov.UK Notify SMS Service\\n-------------------------\\n\\nAll SMS texts and phone numbers, processed on the server, are deleted once a SMS text message has been successfully transmitted. This 'sever' is physically / electronically separated from the servers supporting the backend of the App. Different service teams will be employed to ensure that identifiable information (mobile phone numbers and test results) are kept separate from the App operational servers, preventing any individuals information being discoverable with the App.\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe flow of data from the BSO test registry through the App backend to\\nthe Gov.UK Notify (SMS Platform) to send an SMS text will be managed by\\ndifferent groups to help reduce any risk of re identification.\\n\\n• The BSO registry contains the mobile numbers of people who have tested\\npositive.\\n\\n• As the Temporary Exposure Key uploads hit the App backend in Amazon\\nWeb Services, it is important this backend data cannot be combined with\\nmobile numbers.\\n\\n• To help prevent this, the Amazon Web Services backend will never store\\nor log the mobile number.\\n\\n• The mobile number will exist in the BSO test registry and will exist\\nin Gov.UK Notify as SMS messages are sent. (Being deleted after this\\naction has been fulfilled).\\n\\nTo facilitate reconciliation for issues that may occur within the Amazon\\nWeb Services backend, a Job ID will be used to track the flow from BSO\\nregistry through Amazon Web Services. When BSO calls the Amazon Web\\nServices REST API it will pass on a Job ID that will be used to uniquely\\nidentify the transaction with the Amazon Web Services flow.\\n\\nThis Job ID will be logged within Amazon Web Services so that in the\\ncase of any failure during processing, the record in the BSO registry\\nthat was not successfully processed can be identified.\\n\\nIn the case of a failure during the Amazon Web Services flow, an alert\\nwill be raised within Amazon Web Services and notified to the NearForm\\nsupport team. The Nearform team will investigate alerts raised and will\\neither address or correct, if the issue is within Amazon Web Services.\\n\\nIf the issue is outside of Amazon Web Services, when appropriate,\\nNearForm will escalate the issue to the BSO support team.\\n\\nBSO will be required to reconcile the Job ID from registry data to the\\nSMS text records on the Gov.UK Notify platform.\\n\\nThe PHA manual Contact Tracing service will also be telephoning all\\npositive test users, so can be scripted to verify that the recipient has\\nreceived a SMS; the call handler will also have the capability of\\nsending an SMS from the Manual Contact Tracing system.\\n\\nDoH / HSCB / PHA\\n----------------\\n\\nThe DoH / HSCN / PHA will retain regional summary level information,\\nrelating to the number of App users / ratio of exposure notifications to\\npositive cases indefinitely, to support evaluation, research and future\\npandemic response planning. This does not involve individual data, nor\\nidentifiable personal data. No identifiable or personal level data is\\ncollected or retained within the system. In order to obtain MHRA\\nRegulatory approval, and CE certification, will involve collation of\\ndata in evidence of the efficacy of the App. In line GMGR Disposal\\nSchedule J - Clinical Trials of Investigational Medicinal Products\\n(CTIMPs) -- this high level summary data will be retained '*for an\\nappropriate period, to allow further analysis by the original or other\\nresearch teams subject to consent, and to support monitoring by\\nregulatory and other authorities*'.\\n<https://www.health-ni.gov.uk/articles/disposal-schedule-section-j>\\n\\nOn occasion of the pandemic being declared as having ended, the App will\\nbe stood down. Users will be instructed to delete it from their phone.\\nAny anonymised data present, at that time, in the AWS servers (on behalf\\nof the DoH to support the App function) will be deleted.\\n\\nData Subject rights\\n-------------------\\n\\nYou have the following data subject rights under GDPR In respect of any\\n**[personal]{.ul}** data processed by the app.\\n\\n-   You have the right to obtain confirmation that your data is\\n    being [processed, and access to your personal\\n    data](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-of-access/)\\n\\n-   You are entitled to have personal data [rectified if it is\\n    inaccurate or\\n    incomplete](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-rectification/)\\n\\n-   You have a right to have personal data [erased and to prevent\\n    processing](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-erasure/)\\n    in certain circumstances\\n\\n-   You have the right to 'block' or suppress processing of personal\\n    data in specific circumstances\\n\\n-   You have the right to [data\\n    portability](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-data-portability/)\\n    in specific circumstances\\n\\n-   You have the right to [object to the\\n    processing,](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-object/)\\n     in specific circumstances\\n\\n-   You have rights in relation to [automated decision making and\\n    profiling](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/rights-related-to-automated-decision-making-including-profiling/)\\n\\nPersonally identifiable data is not processed or retained by the App.\\n\\nChanges to this Data Protection Information Notice\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis Data Protection Information Notice may change from time to time and\\nyou will receive notification of this update in the app.\\n\\n**How to complain if you are not happy with how we process your personal\\ninformation**\\n\\nIf you are unhappy with any aspect of this privacy notice, or how your personal information is being processed, please contact the Department's Data Protection Officer at the address above.\\nIf you are still not happy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO):\\n\\nInformation Commissioner's OfficeWycliffe HouseWater LaneWilmslowCheshireSK9 5AF\\n\\n**Tel:** 0303 123 1113\\n\\n**Email:** <casework@ico.org.uk>\\n\\n**Website:** [Information Commissioner's Office](https://ico.org.uk/global/contact-us/)\\n"},"dpinText":{"en":"The Department of Health NI\\n\\n25/06/2020\\n\\nDraft - version 2.2\\n\\nStopCOVID NI Tracker App \\n========================\\n\\nThe Department of Health (\\\"DoH\\\") in Northern Ireland proposes to\\nintroduce a mobile application called the COVID Tracker App (\\\"StopCOVID\\nNI\\\"), as part of its Track Trace and Protect project. The app, which\\nwill be entirely voluntary for the public to download and use, is\\nintended to act in parallel, and augment the Public Health Agency's\\n(\\\"PHA\\\") COVID-19 contact tracing service, assisting in breaking chains\\nof transmission, and reducing the spread of the viral infection in the\\ncommunity.\\n\\nThe purpose of this document is to transparently assess the impact of\\nthe envisaged processing operations on the protection of personal data\\nand how the rights to privacy and confidentiality of the users are\\nappropriately protected. In light of the scale of the envisaged data\\nprocessing, types of data processing and use of new technology, the\\ncarrying out of this assessment is considered appropriate.\\n\\nOverview \\n--------\\n\\nTesting and contact tracing is seen as a cornerstone of strategies\\nemployed by countries to contain the spread of the coronavirus and save\\nlives across the globe. On the 12^th^ May 2020 the NI Executive\\npublished the document, 'CORONAVIRUS; EXECUTIVE APPROACH TO\\nDECISION-MAKING' outlining a 'pathway to recovery' and stating \\\"As\\ncontext to its reviews, the Executive will take account of measures to\\nreduce transmission, including the increased availability of testing,\\nthe use of surveillance or tracking methodology and contact tracing for\\nthose who test positive for Coronavirus or who meet an appropriate\\nclinical case definition. Where IT solutions, such as Apps, can assist,\\nwe will use them and encourage you to do the same. However, no matter\\nhow good such Apps are, they will have limited value unless used widely\\nacross society.\\\" [^1].\\n\\nWithin the context of the national public-health led response to\\nCOVID-19 in Northern Ireland, the DoH is developing a mobile phone\\napplication. The app will support the Northern Ireland public health\\nresponse to COVID-19 by working in parallel to the main contact tracing\\nprocess already in operation by the Public Health Agency (PHA).\\n\\nThe app is being developed because using mobile technology can improve\\nthe speed and accuracy of manual contact tracing. With mobile\\ntechnology, contact tracing teams will no longer have to solely rely on\\na person who has COVID-19 to remember everyone they were in contact\\nwith. The app will allow people (using the app) in close contact with a\\nCOVID-19 case (who has also been using the app) to be notified faster,\\nto commence self-isolation, preventing onward transmission of the\\ninfection, helping us stay ahead of the virus and save lives.\\n\\nRoles and Responsibilities\\n--------------------------\\n\\nFor the purposes of the app, the DoH NI is the data controller, as it is\\ndetermining the means and purposes of the processing. The DoH is\\nresponsible for the development, testing, security, operation and\\nmaintenance of the app. The DoH is providing strategic leadership for\\nthe app, and the Department's Covid-19 Gold Digital Cell is procuring\\nthe app on behalf of the DOH, to ensure that government policies are\\ntranslated into actions and implemented effectively. The DoH does not\\nintend to collect any personal data from the app; no location data, no\\nsymptom data, and no identifying data will be processed. The app's only\\nfunction is to provide a notification to 'high risk contacts' of an app\\nuser who tests positive for COVID-19. At a regional level, aggregated\\nnumbers of positive test codes input, and notifications sent will be\\navailable. None of this will be identifiable to any individual or be\\nable to be linked (test codes to notifications). Decentralised\\narchitecture is being employed to ensure preservation of identity and\\nmaximum privacy.\\n\\nAn app Steering Committee (see Appendix A) has been formed to provide an\\nexternal oversight and governance function, in relation to the app\\ndevelopment, (in terms of expertise to ensure that code and system\\narchitecture complies with the ICO guidance- 'COVID-19 Contact tracing:\\ndata protection expectations on app development'). This group is tasked\\nwith, amongst other responsibilities, ensuring that the app is used for\\nits intended purpose, data processing is appropriately bounded in time\\nand scope, that this DPIA report is kept under review and up to date,\\nand co-ordinating the necessary research and analysis to assess the\\nefficacy of the app.\\n\\nThere are a number of data processors and other roles that are assisting\\nthe DoH in designing, building and operating the app, these are listed\\nin Appendix B.\\n\\nProcessing Overview\\n-------------------\\n\\nUse of the app will be entirely voluntary and will be available to\\ndownload for free from the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. It\\nwill run on iPhones that support iOS 13.5 (or later) and Android phones\\nrunning Android 6.0 and higher. The functions of the app that fulfil the\\nstated purposes are as follows.\\n\\n### Contact Tracing\\n\\nThe Public Health Agency (PHA) currently operates a Contact Tracing\\nCentre to perform manual contact tracing. This is the process where a\\nperson who has been infected with COVID-19 is interviewed over the phone\\nto identify the people they have been in close contact with since their\\nsymptom onset date minus 48 hours ('infectious period'). A 'high risk\\ncontact' is defined as being where people spend more than 15 minutes\\nwithin 2 meters of each other. These close contacts are then phoned and\\ngiven advice to self-isolate for 14 days, in line with public health\\npolicy, thus restricting the spread of the virus. The Contact Tracing\\nfunctionality delivered by the app is being designed to augment the\\ncurrent manual contact tracing operation in Northern Ireland, and is\\nproposed to work as follows:\\n\\n-   When a person downloads the app they are asked to enable its Contact\\n    Tracing function. If they choose to do so the person will be asked\\n    to turn on the phone's Exposure Notification Services (ENS) service.\\n    ENS is a new Bluetooth feature that Apple and Google are introducing\\n    to support contact tracing efforts across the globe using iPhones\\n    and Android phones in a privacy preserving way.[^2]\\n\\n-   Continuous scanning -- phones with ENS active will continuously scan\\n    for other phones nearby with ENS active. When proximity is detected,\\n    the phones record this by sending each other random IDs without the\\n    need for any user action, and include information on Bluetooth\\n    signal strengths to be used later for distance estimating.\\n\\n-   A rolling 14 days' worth of theses IDs and accompanying information,\\n    recording a person's recent encounters, are securely stored on the\\n    user's phone. These IDs cannot be used to identify you. Also, ENS,\\n    and thus Contact Tracing can be turned off and on, independent of\\n    the other app functions, at any time.\\n\\n-   Positive diagnosis - if a person tests positive for the virus the\\n    app user will be contacted by phone via automated sms (where\\n    possible), by email, or by a call. The contact details are from\\n    information volunteered by a person booking a test on the NHS\\n    portal. No record of the sms is retained once generated and sent.\\n    The message of a positive test will contain a random 6 digit numeric\\n    authorisation code, for input into the app. For those not able to\\n    receive a sms, they will be called directly and be asked if they are\\n    using the app. If so, a code will be provided to input via the audio\\n    phone call. This code will only remain valid for 30 minutes. When\\n    the code is entered into the app, this authorises an upload of their\\n    anonymised IDs. (relating to 'high risk' contacts and processed on\\n    the phone) to the app backend architecture hosted in a secure\\n    environment in an AWS account. The backend architecture then makes\\n    these anonymised IDs visible to instances of the app on other users\\n    phones, covering only the infectious period of 14 days. The user\\n    with a positive test is informed this will happen before authorising\\n    the release. This enables other app users who have been in 'high\\n    risk' contact with an app user (who has tested positive) to be\\n    notified. At no point is any identification of app users possible.\\n\\n-   All those testing positive will also be contacted via the manual\\n    contact tracing process. The app has the advantage of notifying\\n    'high risk contacts' who are app users, who may be unknown to the\\n    person testing positive. The app improves the possibility of\\n    breaking chains of transmission of the viral infection. Notifying\\n    unknown 'high risk contacts' in a timely manner (within a couple of\\n    hours of a test result being known).\\n\\n-   Exposure notification - all apps download all new IDs every 2 hours\\n    from the registry and compare against the recorded IDs on their\\n    phone. If there is a match based on the HSE case definition, which\\n    is based on European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control\\n    recommendations that a close contact is within 2 metres for 15\\n    minutes or more, the phone alerts the user that they have been\\n    exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.\\n\\nThe phone displays the most recent date they were exposed and presents\\nadvice in accordance with public health guidance for close contacts,\\nincluding self-isolation for a period of 14 days, and if symptomatic,\\nadvice to get tested. Exposure notifications remain visible on the app\\nfor 14 days from the date of last exposure. Users can clear exposure\\nnotifications from their app at any time via settings. If a user\\nreceives multiple exposure notifications relating to different exposure\\nevents, they only receive a new alert if the exposure notification\\nrelates to a more recent exposure event.\\n\\nAny individual in NI can book a test via the national portal. Patients\\nmay be advised to get a test via multiple sources: e.g. the 111\\nhelpline, COVID-19 NI smartphone and online app, normal clinical\\nconsultations with a GP or the GP OOH service. For individuals booking a\\ntest via the NHS Portal, they are asked to provide contact details,\\n(phone number or email address) in order to receive a result\\nnotification. Results are also passed from the National Pathology\\nExchange (NPEx), to the HSC Test registry in the Business Services\\nOrganisation (BSO) who are data processors for this data on behalf of\\nPHA the data controller for test data. The portal and testing data sit\\noutside the app and this processing is covered off under separate\\nInformation Governance arrangements with specific DPIAs and Privacy\\nNotices held by PHA and DHSC. The PHA will also call the person and\\nguide them as per the current contact tracing operations. When someone\\nreceives and exposure notification via the app, they are advised to\\nself-isolate and book a test if they become symptomatic. The phone\\nnumber of the user receiving a notification or the number of the person\\ntesting positive are not visible via the app and will not be shared.\\nFurthermore the PHA are not aware of an exposure notification in any\\nway. If a person self-isolating after a notification becomes symptomatic\\nand books a test, should the test be positive they will become\\nsymptomatic they will be followed up in the manual tracing process. If\\nthey are an app user, they will receive a 6 digit code for input,\\nreleasing anonymous notifications to 'high risk' contacts processed on\\nthe phone, within the 14 day time period prior to a test result being\\ninput.\\n\\n### Other Functions\\n\\nMetric Gathering -- the app seeks permission from the user to collect\\nin-app metrics, and if given, records and shares data relating to how a\\nperson is using the app. This permission can be granted or revoked\\nduring the initial app 'on-boarding' screens and via the app settings at\\nany time. The metrics collected do not reveal a person's identity and\\nare shared on a daily basis with the DoH. The purposes for the\\ncollection of metric data are to understand if there are any functional\\nproblems with the app, how users are using the app, the impact the app\\nis having to help control the spread of the virus and to guide\\nimprovements in its design and functioning.\\n\\nThe types of metric collected include app abandonment points (especially\\nduring initial screens), use levels of app functions and constituent\\nscreens, numbers of exposure notifications, numbers of positive cases\\nuploading random IDs. The metric data will be transmitted to the DoH on\\na daily basis by the app at a scheduled time without user action. All\\nmetrics will be sent to the DoH to publish for analysis by health and\\npublic health teams on a daily basis and used for the purposes outlined.\\nThe DoH will also store and analyse metrics in close to real-time\\nrelating directly to the performance and functioning of the app. Metrics\\nare collected without the use of any 3^rd^ party tools. A further\\nbreakdown of all metrics collected is included in Appendix D.\\n\\nLeave Function -- the app provides a leave function that can be used at\\nany time. Selecting this deletes all app data from the phone. The user\\nwill be notified that they can also delete ENS data via the phone device\\nsettings as the app does not have direct control or access to ENS data.\\nIf Leave is selected, non-identifying security token data that is used\\nto associate valid (device integrity checked) apps with the app backend\\nis removed from the app backend. If the app is simply deleted from the\\nphone, it has the same effect as Leave, however the security tokens are\\nnot removed as the app backend has no way of knowing -- they will be\\ndeleted after a period of 60 days of not being used.\\n\\nApp Settings -- the app will provide a number of settings that can be\\nconfigured by the user at any time. This section of the app ensures that\\nusers are given a clear view of the data that is being processed and\\nallows them to give and withdraw consent. App settings provides the\\nfollowing:\\n\\n-   Contact Tracing function is displayed as on or off and the user is\\n    directed to the ENS phone settings where it can be turned on or off;\\n\\n-   Exposure notifications can be cleared from the app if relevant;\\n\\n-   A link to the Data Protection Information Notice for convenient\\n    access at any time.\\n\\nShare function -- the app makes it easy for users to share it with\\nothers who may choose to download it also. The success of contact\\ntracing apps relies on widespread adoption by communities who\\ncollectively can help protect themselves and others.\\n\\n### Systems where personal data will be processed\\n\\nPersonal data will be collected, processed and stored in the following\\nlocations and IT systems:\\n\\n1.  The app -- on users' phones where data is stored and encrypted on\\n    the device.\\n\\n2.  The app backend -- the backend services are hosted by Amazon Web\\n    Services (AWS). The app uploads all COVID Check-in data, ID uploads\\n    and metric data to the backend services. The app also downloads IDs\\n    for exposure matching from the backend services. All data is\\n    encrypted in transit and at rest, and is locked to the London\\n    Region.\\n\\n3.  Backend linkage with the RoI backend -- to enable interoperability\\n    with the ROI, in line with EU recommendations\\n\\n    1.  ### Technical Data Flows and Architecture\\n\\nTechnical data flows and the technical architecture of the app will be\\nfurther set out in a series of diagrams which will be published\\nonline.[^3]\\n\\nScope of Processing\\n-------------------\\n\\nThis section of the document describes the data that will be processed,\\nhow much data is being collected and used, how often it will be\\nprocessed, how long it will be retained for, and who the data relates\\nto.\\n\\n### Data Subjects \\n\\nThe proposed data processing relates to all individuals in the country\\nthat choose to download and install the app that have a smartphone\\ncapable of meeting the ENS requirements set out previously. The app will\\nbe published in the UK app stores only, making clear that it is intended\\nfor download by individuals residing in Northern Ireland to download and\\ninstall it. To support contact tracing for app users travelling across\\nthe border with the ROI, (it has been estimated that before lockdown,\\nthere were 30,000 individuals crossing the border on a daily basis),\\nbackend linkage will be enabled (in line with EU recommendations) to\\ndeliver interoperability. Cross border interoperability is something\\nthat the European Commission and separately Google and Apple are working\\non. The DoH is working in cooperation with counterparts in the ROI to\\ndeliver interoperability to EU requirements.\\n\\n### Data Retention\\n\\nThere are various retention limits on different types of data being\\nprocessed and these are outlined in tabular form later in this section\\nof the document. An overarching policy of data retention in relation to\\nthe app is that no data captured will be processed beyond the period of\\nthe pandemic in line with recent European Data Protection Board's\\nguidelines on the introduction of such apps. The terms of reference\\ncharge the App Steering Committee to ensure that an orderly wind down of\\nthe app and the removal of all data captured is implemented within 90\\ndays of the end of the COVID-19 crisis. The end of the COVID-19 crisis\\nand the wind down of the app will be determined by Government taking\\nadvice from the Chief Medical Officer in NI. The wind down will include\\nmeasures such as of the issuance of clear guidelines for app deletion,\\nremoval of the app from app stores, the secure destruction of all\\ncaptured data and diagnosis keys from backend servers, and the shutting\\ndown of all app backend services.\\n\\nUsers of the app have the right to be forgotten. Selecting the Leave\\nfunction will remove all data held by the app and any security token\\ndata on the app backend. The Leave function will also inform the user\\nthat ENS is a phone service and will give guidance on how to remove ENS\\ndata via the ENS service settings. Deleting the app from your phone will\\nalso remove all app data from the phone, and the security token data\\nwill be automatically removed 60 days after last use. The removal of all\\napp data and ENS data can be done at any time, and the DOH has no way of\\nknowing who selects Leave or uninstalls the app.\\n\\n### IP Address\\n\\nAll API calls to the DoH will unavoidably result in app users' IP\\naddresses being present in data communicated between the app and the\\nnetwork servers due to the nature of networking. The DoH will not use IP\\naddresses for identification purposes. As a precaution, IP addresses of\\nusers are never transmitted from the networking layer to the backend\\nservers thus minimising the possibility of inadvertently recombining IP\\naddress and app generated data.\\n\\nUnder these circumstances it is reasonable to consider that no personal\\ndata is processed by the COVID Tracker app. Users receive an SMS code to\\nauthorise (following a positive test) the upload of random IDs to the\\nregistry on positive diagnosis. Users may also be given a code via a\\nphone call or email. Users have the option not to upload these codes.\\n\\nHowever, without prejudice, this DPIA takes a conservative approach and\\nconsiders IP address as personal data, and thus acts as a personal\\nidentifier. As such all app data transferred to and from the DoH backend\\nservers relating to a person is considered personal data and will be\\nhandled as such.\\n\\n### Download and Installation\\n\\nTo install the app, a user downloads the app from either the Google or\\nApple app stores. Each store will keep a record of the user's download\\nof the app using their unique identifier, AppleID or GoogleID, with the\\nstore. Apple and Google are Data Controllers in respect of their\\nrespective app stores and gather certain statistics about app usage,\\nsuch as number of downloads, number of deletions. More information is\\npublicly available in regards how data is processed by the app stores.\\n\\n### Exposure Notification Services\\n\\nIt is worth going into further detail on the workings of ENS at this\\nstage to support the rest of this section. Each phone that has ENS\\nswitched on generates a random daily key, which is stored on the phone,\\nand called a Temporary Exposure Key (TEK). These keys are used to\\nfurther generate random IDs approximately every 15 minutes called\\nRolling Proximity Identifiers (RPI), which are used to send to other ENS\\nenabled phones when nearby. RPIs are accompanied by Associated Encrypted\\nMetadata data, which includes protocol versioning and Bluetooth\\ntransmission power. The TEK keys are uploaded to the DoH on positive\\ndiagnosis and are called Diagnosis Keys at this point. These are\\npublically available, downloaded by all apps, and used to regenerate the\\nRPIs -- which are in turn used check for a match, on the phone, in order\\nto generate an exposure notification. RPI and AEM data are processed on\\nphones only; not available directly to contact tracing apps; are stored\\nfor 14 days; are not capable of being used to identify a person; and are\\nnot considered personal data.\\n\\n### Personal Data\\n\\nThe following scope for personal data processing has been determined.\\nAll data uploaded to the DOH should be considered to have IP addresses\\nremoved at the networking layer of the app backend and put beyond use. A\\nrigorous data minimisation approach has been adopted in relation to\\npersonal data processing, and only personal data that is necessary for\\nthe proper operation of the app will be processed. The following table\\nsets out the personal data that will be processed by the app, along with\\na description of the data, the type of data, how often the data is\\nprocessed, who processes it and for how long. A more detailed technical\\nlist of all data processed by the app on the phone and on the backend\\nservers will be published online.[^4]\\n\\nContext of Processing\\n---------------------\\n\\nThis section of the document sets out the relationship the DoH has with\\ndata subjects, how much control they have over the data processed, what\\ntype of people make up the data subjects. It also sets the context in\\nregards the privacy concerns that people may have with the app.\\n\\n### Design Principles\\n\\nThrough how the app is implemented, the app's governance and the\\nsupporting communications, we will ensure a set of design principles are\\nadhered to through the design, build and operation of the app. In\\nparticular, governance arrangements are in place via an App Steering\\nCommittee where the terms of reference charge it to uphold a set of\\nprinciples. These principles include the following.\\n\\n-   The app is entirely voluntary to use;\\n\\n-   The app is used to augment the existing manual contact tracing\\n    process;\\n\\n-   The app is used for the purposes set out in the DPIA, and only in\\n    the context of the COVID-19 crisis;\\n\\n-   The app is to be decommissioned once the COVID-19 crisis is over;\\n\\n-   The app processes data as set out in the DPIA and Privacy Notice,\\n    the DPIA and Privacy Notice are accessible to the public and kept up\\n    to date;\\n\\n-   The app does not use location services to track the location of\\n    users or for any other purpose;\\n\\n-   The app does not, and will never, reveal the identity of a person\\n    infected with COVID-19;\\n\\n-   The app must be able to function while the screen is locked.\\n\\nThe trust of the public in the proposed processing of data and\\nappropriate privacy measures are of paramount importance to engender\\nadoption of the app. The DoH is committed to transparency in the\\ndevelopment and operation of the app and to that end the source code and\\nthis DPIA document and related documents will be published to the public\\nonline as soon as they are ready.[^5] These will be kept up to date to\\nreflect the live operation of the system and the data being processed.\\nFurthermore, robust processes will be put in place to perform security\\ntesting and respond to security issues during the development and the\\noperation of the app.\\n\\n### Privacy Model\\n\\nAs mentioned previously, the Contact Tracing function uses a new Android\\nand iPhone service called Exposure Notification Services (ENS). Only\\nnationally recognised health authorities will be able to produce an app\\nthat is authorised to use ENS. Apps that do use ENS have limited levels\\nof access to ENS data. Examples of this includes -- apps are not allowed\\ndirect access to the random IDs being exchanged with nearby phones\\n(RPIs); they are restricted in checking for exposure matches a maximum\\nof 15 times per day; and they cannot get access to diagnosis keys\\nwithout the user's explicit permission. In general apps are restricted\\nin how they can use ENS in order to preserve the privacy design of the\\nservice. ENS follows what is informally called a 'decentralised' model\\nfor mobile app contact tracing, which allows people to get exposure\\nnotifications without sharing personal data with a health authority or\\nanyone else. The DoH is committed to this design principle. The DoH will\\nindependently test the robustness and security of the ENS service.\\n\\n### Children\\n\\nIn line with UK legislation, safeguarding protections would be necessary\\nfor individuals under the age of 18 years using the app. This would be\\nproblematic as there is no definitive age for children's consent in the\\nUK; and due to the nature of the app, gaining consent would be\\nproblematic. Due to the need for anonymity there won't be any facility\\nfor direct contact with users, or a mechanism to monitor this. The DoH\\nwould have no way of checking a child's capacity to consent. For that\\nreason, prospective app users will be asked to confirm that they are 18\\nyears or older at the time of downloading the app. Enforcing this is\\nalso problematic. App store controls will be put in place to restrict\\navailability of the app to the extent that is possible. Google play\\nstore can restrict downloads from aged 16 and above; the Apple app store\\ncan restrict from aged 17 and above -- these settings will be applied.\\nDue to the overriding nature of the need to deliver a proximity app\\nsolution that meets ICO guidance for anonymity, there is no identified\\nmechanism for further age verification possible. It is seen as a\\nsignificant challenge to reliably seek parental consent to support\\nyounger users of the app at this stage. It is not clear at this time how\\nthis can be achieved in a practical way that can scale. Furthermore, it\\nis not clear the appropriateness of alerting young people with exposure\\nnotifications as they may not be in the presence of a guardian at the\\ntime. As it is in the public interest to have a first release of the app\\navailable to the public in NI as soon as possible, (supporting contact\\ntracing measures to reduce COVID-19 transmission as 'lockdown\\nrestrictions' are released) the app will be released with an age\\nchallenge included, asking the user to affirm that they are 18 years of\\nage, or older. It is not perceived that any harm will result for\\nindividuals younger than 18 years of age using the app, due to the\\nprotections built in to protect privacy. Consultation will be undertaken\\nwith the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People to\\nexplore options for inclusion of individuals younger than 18 years of\\nage, while meeting the complex competing requirements of inclusion,\\nsafeguarding and anonymity. Having taken advice, the DoH will commit to\\nimplementing any agreed modifications in subsequent releases of the app,\\npost launch.\\n\\n### Novelty and Robustness\\n\\nThe DoH are heavily engaged with other countries who are introducing\\nsimilar apps to help stop the spread of the virus. As this use of phones\\nis new, this type of engagement is important, and the project team will\\ncontinue to engage, contribute and learn from others in the field.\\nFurthermore, the team are in regular contact with Google and Apple,\\nworking with these companies to shape the design and functioning of ENS\\nto maximise the value to society and people's health, while protecting\\nthe rights to privacy. The use of ENS is considered the best route to a\\nrobust working version of the Contact Tracing function. ENS is to\\nprovide the ability for apps that implement contact tracing to be\\nfunctional on both Android and iPhone devices, with the app running in\\nboth in the background and foreground; a significant challenge to date.\\nFurthermore, it is expected from discussions with Apple and Google that\\nENS will be heavily optimised and tested for efficient battery use and\\nwill not interfere with other Bluetooth peripherals -- also a\\nsignificant challenge to date for current contact tracing apps.\\n\\nThe DoH is, engaged in its own testing (contracting services from an\\nindependent private sector company offering expertise in assurance\\nprocess and security penetration testing) of the app to ensure the\\nproduct is robust, reliable, and privacy preserving, including testing\\nin a Northern Irish specific context with regard to its particular\\nenvironment (e.g. building types, typical bus configurations, etc.)\\nFollowing launch of the app, the DoH will engage with colleagues in the\\nROI to provide testing for QA purposes, to ensure functioning\\ninteroperability an optimal deployment. The scientific community\\ncontinues to play an important role in the Northern Irish response to\\nCovid-19. The University of Ulster and Queen's University Belfast are\\nboth represented on the App Steering Committee, providing expert advice\\nand oversight.\\n\\n### Accessibility\\n\\nThe app has been carefully designed to be clear and transparent in how\\nit works, to ensure consent, where sought, can be freely given, to make\\nit possible for people to opt in (and out) of the functions provided,\\nand to update their data at any time.\\n\\nUser Experience of the app has been tested within behavioural studies\\ninforming the app flow and content. There is little interaction required\\nfor setting up the Contact Tracing function, no user data is required,\\nand it can run in the background without user interaction -- thus\\nreducing to as much as is possible any barriers to entry. Accessibility\\ntesting has been included in the initial app release, and will be for\\nsubsequent releases. In future, development of Irish language version,\\nand support of other commonly used languages within the country will\\nalso be considered.\\n\\nStakeholder Engagement\\n----------------------\\n\\nA series of public and stakeholder consultations to support and inform\\nthe development and subsequent deployment of the app is part of the\\nongoing project activities. The purpose of these consultations is to\\ngather views, perspectives, and experiences from experts and members of\\nthe public on a range of interrelated issues. From a development\\nperspective, the following issues will be explored: privacy, appropriate\\nuse of data, cybersecurity, data accuracy, and accessibility. From a\\nsocietal perspective, the following issues will be assessed: social\\ninequalities, ethical implications, engagement with health services, and\\nuser expectations, needs and engagement.\\n\\n### Engaging the scientific community \\n\\nLeverage of the Irish research already conducted in development of their\\napp, and scientific evaluation of the infrastructure supporting it, is\\nan important part of assisting the DoH in NI in its response to\\nCovid-19. The team have engaged with the scientific community in NI,\\nwith representation from both universities in NI on the App Steering\\nGroup, and the project will continue to be guided by the input from the\\nexpert independent representatives.\\n\\n### Patient Client Council (+ other stakeholders)\\n\\nParagraph to be inserted on engagement activities\\n\\n### Consultation with the ICO in NI\\n\\nParagraph to be inserted\\n\\n### Research and evidence for policy \\n\\nParagraph to be inserted\\n\\nCompliance with data protection law and other regulatory guidance\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n### This section considers compliance with GDPR, the Data Protection Act 2018, other related legal obligations and data protection guidelines.\\n\\n### \\n\\n### Legislative Framework \\n\\nUnder provisions of the Public Health Act (Northern Ireland) 1967, the\\nDoH is to introduce the app as a COVID-19 pandemic response app to\\nprotect the health and welfare of the public. The legal basis for the\\nproposed data processing by the app relies on consent. The processing\\ninvolves both ordinary and special categories of data and as such both\\nGDPR 6.1(a) and 9.2(a) are used. Clear, explicit consent, in an\\nintelligible and easily accessible form is sought for each of the\\npersonal data processing activities listed in the below table. Having\\nregard for the entirely voluntary and discretionary nature of\\ndownloading the app, and noting that the DoH cannot determine whether a\\nperson has installed the app or not, it is not considered that an\\n\\\"imbalance of power\\\" (GDPR recital 43) arises.\\n\\nThe PHA, currently operate an existing manual contact tracing operation,\\nwhich the app will interact with in defined ways. This DPIA makes clear\\nthese interaction points, what data processed by the app and app backend\\nis possibly processed by the CTC, in what scenarios and for what\\npurposes, and confirms that the user is appropriately informed. This\\nassessment does not include an assessment of the CTC services, save to\\nthe points just made.\\n\\nThe following sets out the legal bases for the processing of personal\\ndata identified in Section 4 of this document. The processing activity\\nis included in brief for convenience.\\n\\n### S.I. No. 336/2011 Obligations\\n\\nThe app involves gaining access to data already stored on the phone\\n(e.g. app metrics, keys upload, authorisation code upload) and storing\\ndata on the phone (i.e.. random ID exchanges) using a webservice and an\\nelectronic communications network and as such SI 336/2011 applies. All\\ndata that falls under this SI in regards the app is deemed strictly\\nnecessary in order to provide a service explicitly requested by a user,\\nand as such the exemption set out in regulation 5 of the SI applies. The\\nexception to this is metric data, where this data access is not strictly\\nnecessary in the provision of a service requested, and as such consent\\nis explicitly sought for within the app before in-app metrics are\\ncollected.\\n\\n### Collaboration with the HSCB\\n\\nAnonymous aggregated data as outlined previously in this document will\\nbe shared with the HSCB for the purposes of statistical reporting and\\nanalysis. The DoH will work with the HSCB in the creation of statistical\\nreports to inform the CMO, DoH and various public health teams on\\nCOVID-19 response policy making and measurement. The legal basis for\\nthis collaboration is Health and Social Care (Control of Data\\nProcessing) Act (Northern Ireland) 2016. An agreement has been entered\\ninto to reflect the terms of this collaboration.\\n\\n### Necessity and Proportionality Assessment\\n\\nNecessity of processing requires that the proposed measures to be\\nintroduced will be effective for the objective pursued and whether it is\\nless intrusive compared to other options for achieving the same goal.\\nProportionality of processing requires that the advantages of the\\nprocessing proposed are not outweighed by the disadvantages the measures\\nmay cause to a person's rights, and as such, a balance must be struck\\nbetween the means used and the intended aim.\\n\\nNecessity and Contact Tracing -- the need to operate a form of contact\\ntracing during the COVID-19 pandemic is beyond doubt. The basic\\noperating principle is that on diagnosing a person with the disease, the\\nclose contacts of that person are identified, generally through\\ninterviews, and appropriate measures are taken in respect of those\\npersons so identified to control the spread of the disease. This is an\\neffective intervention in the fight against COVID-19 and has been\\ndeployed worldwide. However, there are inherent challenges to manual\\ncontact tracing.\\n\\nIn a review of international literature it was found that manual forms\\nof contact tracing are overly reliant on recall (Leong et al., 2009) and\\nit is argued that, for a highly infectious disease with a long\\nincubation period, capacity to recall decreases and the likelihood of\\nthe disease being spread beyond known and usual contacts increases (Hart\\net al., April 2020). Furthermore, manual contact tracing also requires\\nsubstantial human resources in the form of contact tracers (Hart et al.,\\nApril 2020). Emerging literature suggests that manual contact tracing\\nprocedures is too slow, lacks efficiency, and occurs at too small a\\nscale to contain Covid-19 (Ferretti et al., March 2020, Hinch et al.,\\nApril 2020). Additional measures have been introduced in Northern\\nIreland, and other countries, to aid in the control of the virus, such\\nas severely restricting persons' movements, working habits and general\\nday to day activities.\\n\\nKey indicators of effective contact tracing are completeness of close\\ncontact identification and speed of close contact identification and\\nsubsequent follow-up, with a view to quickly and significantly reduce\\nthe viral transmission potential. The objective of using a mobile app\\nbased contact tracing solution as a supplement to the existing manual\\ncontact tracing is to *increase the completeness of close contacts\\nidentified*, and *increase the speed in which those close contacts are\\nidentified and given the appropriate guidance*.\\n\\nA recent survey of over 2000 people carried out in the ROI by Amárach\\nResearch on the 15^th^ of May 2020 found that 70% of those surveyed\\nwould install a mobile app that carried out contact tracing (with 15%\\nundecided). Recent introduction of mobile apps, though new and only\\npublished in a small number of countries so far (noting that almost all\\nEU MS countries have indicated plans to introduce such apps in the\\nfuture), have ranged in adoption from approximately 20% to 40%. Although\\na small uptake can have an impact on reducing transmission, it is clear\\nthat the higher the uptake the greater the positive potential of the\\nmeasure.\\n\\nIt is significant to note that the DoH is intending to introduce an app\\nbased on the Apple and Google's ENS service. Apps introduced in other\\ncountries to date have not been so based (as ENS hasn't been available),\\nand have had significant functional difficulties, namely not\\nfunctioning, or severely hampered functioning, on iPhones, issues with\\nbattery life, and interference problems with Bluetooth peripherals.\\nFurthermore, these apps have generally been based on a 'centralised'\\napproach, where the public health authority require access to\\nsignificant amount of contact tracing data of positive and close\\ncontacts, for which there have been privacy concerns raised. Concerns\\nover these factors may have hampered adoption.\\n\\nThe use of ENS is intended to solve the referenced issues regarding the\\nbasic core functionality proposition of proximity detection. Furthermore\\nit is based on the decentralised model, removing the need to share\\ncontact traces with a central authority. It is also expected that as\\nmore and more countries adopt the ENS service, which there is\\nconsiderable momentum towards across the EU, a consolidation of\\nimprovements in product robustness and interoperability across borders\\nwill emerge. Alternative approaches to meeting the objectives stated\\nabove included the use of a centralised model and GPS/location tracking,\\nand while certain benefits prevail over the proposed approach for\\nN.Ireland (namely assistance in cluster identification), significant\\nprivacy concerns exist with these approaches and they are not being\\npursued.\\n\\nIn consideration of the objectives sought, the rationale and context for\\nthese objectives; the expectation that the proposed Contact Tracing\\nfunction will be effective and adopted by people in light of the privacy\\npreserving decentralised model chosen, and the ENS technology selected;\\nthe indicated support for installing such an app function; and the\\nfunction being deemed the least intrusive measure to achieve the stated\\nobjectives, the proposed data processing in the Contact Tracing function\\nof the app is seen to be necessary.\\n\\nProportionality and Contact Tracing -- there is a clear and pressing\\nsocial need for a fast and effective contact tracing operation, one of\\nthe main pillars in controlling the spread of the virus. There is a\\nreasonable expectation that the Contact Tracing function in the app will\\nmeet the need to increase the completeness and speed of close contact\\nidentification and follow-up, when used in combination with the existing\\ncontact tracing operation currently in place. The challenges regarding\\ncompleteness and timeliness of close contact identification and\\nfollow-up is a particular concern, especially as movement, social and\\nwork related restrictions are eased. The introduction of the Contact\\nTracing function of the app is expected to help mitigate these issues as\\nperson to person interaction increases, especially interactions where\\npeople are not known to each other or wouldn't be typically reported\\nduring a manual interview process.\\n\\nGovernance safeguards to limit the scope and extent of interference with\\ndata protection and privacy rights are in place through the terms of\\nreference of the App Steering Committee, ensuring data is processed in\\nline with its purpose and principles, including the full wind-down of\\ndata processing when the COVID-19 crisis is over, and the ongoing\\nmonitoring of the effectiveness of the app and appropriate wind-down if\\nit is not. Through the design and implementation of the Contact Tracing\\nfunction these rights are further protected by ensuring it is and\\ncontinues to be entirely voluntary in nature, that users are asked for\\ntheir clear and explicit consent if they wish to turn on ENS, and upload\\ntheir diagnosis keys.\\n\\nLocation services are never used to track the location of users, where\\ninstead Bluetooth is used to detect proximity without any location data,\\nmeeting its purpose in a data minimised way. Consent can be withdrawn at\\nany time for the processing of all Contact Tracing data and can be\\ndeleted under the control of the data subject, independently and without\\nthe knowledge of the DoH. There is no consequence to not using the app\\nas the DoH cannot tell who has and who hasn't installed the app. Having\\ntaken into account the necessity set out above and the limited\\ninterference with data subject rights, the processing proposed under the\\nContact Tracing function of the app is seen as necessary and\\nproportionate.\\n\\nNecessity and proportionality of App metrics -- the processing of app\\nmetric data is a supporting form of processing for the performance of\\nthe above functions and to monitor their effectiveness. It is also\\nintended to give the public health teams insights into the functioning\\nof the app, such as the number of exposure notifications per day, for\\nuse in health policy formulation and measurement. It does not collect,\\nnor share personally identifiable information (save for IP address).\\nUsers consent to the collection of the data, and can turn this on and\\noff at any time. It is considered to have little interference with\\nindividuals' rights, and is seen as necessary and proportionate.\\n\\n### Technical and Organisational Measures\\n\\nTechnical and organisational measures will be put in place prior to the\\nlaunch of the app to ensure the information processed in relation to the\\nCOVID Tracker app is carried out only as detailed in this DPIA and\\nultimately only for the purposes intended. The DOH is designing,\\ndeveloping and putting in place the required organisational measures to\\nensure the privacy preserving approach to the app and the protection of\\nthe fundamental rights of individuals to privacy and data protection are\\nestablished and maintained.\\n\\nThe organisational security measures implemented include the following.\\n\\n-   The DoH has engaged a specialist information security advisory at an\\n    early stage in the design, development, testing and operational\\n    planning of the app. The company providing this service is a\\n    National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) approved service provider.\\n    Support has been provided directly by the NCSC, in oversight of\\n    penetration testing process, and advising on likely threats and\\n    mitigations.\\n\\n-   An appropriate separation of roles will be employed, for example\\n    developers will manage the development and test environments, and\\n    the operations team will manage the production environment. The\\n    development team will have no access to the production environment,\\n    or data stored there.\\n\\n-   The app will be independently tested from an information security\\n    perspective. This will include the app on the phone and the app\\n    backend services. An independent company has been engaged to provide\\n    assurance testing.\\n\\n-   All access to the app backend databases on AWS will be logged and\\n    the audit trails of this activity will be preserved. Audit logs of\\n    access are captured and will be reviewed for compliance by BSO IT\\n    Security, on behalf of the DoH.\\n\\nThe app backend uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) London Region (via a\\nHealth & Social Care Board NI account) and the highly available services\\nthat it provides, and in so doing, the DoH has ensured an appropriate\\nlevel of availability of the backend infrastructure to support the\\npotential high level of take-up of the app. All services will be\\nconfigured with appropriate availability groups in the London region\\ndata centre from AWS, and ensure the data resides only in Northern\\nIreland administered presence on the AWS facility. The use of AWS\\nensures that the solution can scale up and down in an elastic fashion to\\ndeal with demand.\\n\\nTechnical privacy and security measures are implemented via encryption\\nat a number of levels and include the following.\\n\\n-   Data in the app - all data that is gathered and stored on the phone\\n    will be encrypted. On both the iOS and Android devices, the\\n    encrypted data will only be accessible once the app is launched, and\\n    then only by the app itself. The encryption does not rely on the\\n    device level encryption that may or may not be enabled on the device\\n    itself. All ENS data -- Diagnosis Keys, Rolling Proximity\\n    Identifiers, and Associated Encrypted Metadata -- are stored\\n    encrypted by the phone's Exposure Notification Services.\\n\\n-   Data in transit -- the data being transferred from the app to the\\n    app backend is encrypted using TLS v1.2 in transit. Minimum TLS and\\n    cipher requirements are defined to prevent weak ciphers being used\\n    and leaving to potential for a \\\"man in the middle\\\" attack. The app\\n    will implement certificate pinning to ensure that the only site it\\n    will negotiate a TLS session with is the COVID Tracker App backend\\n    in AWS and not any other TLS enabled service. This also ensures that\\n    only COVID Tracker Apps will be able to negotiate a session with the\\n    AWS backend and limit any potential attack surface and removes the\\n    potential for attackers to flood the app backend with fraudulent\\n    symptom data.\\n\\n-   Data in the app backend -- once the data has been received by the\\n    networking and routing layer of the app backend and processed, it\\n    will then be transferred to a database where it will be stored in an\\n    encrypted format. This database is not accessible from the Internet\\n    and is only accessible on a private network connection in AWS, from\\n    application servers in London.\\n\\nA number of security hardening measures are in place to protect against\\nmalicious actors, these include the following.\\n\\n-   The DoH has engaged a Penetration Test and Application Security team\\n    to analyse the app code prior to release and ensure the technical\\n    security measures have been implemented correctly.\\n\\n-   This team will also perform Penetration Testing and Application\\n    Security Testing on the AWS API gateway (this is the service that\\n    the app communicates with in the app backend).\\n\\n-   Web Application Firewall is implemented to provide an application\\n    layer assessment of API traffic to remove potential threats prior to\\n    the data being processed by the API gateway.\\n\\n-   Continuous Vulnerability Assessment will be engaged for the API\\n    gateway and AWS services for as long as the service remains active.\\n\\n-   The team will be analysing the Bluetooth communications for Exposure\\n    Notification Services to ensure the integrity of the user device is\\n    maintained. The design of the app and contact tracing ensures that\\n    there is no requirement to \\\"pair\\\" the device from a Bluetooth\\n    perspective.\\n\\nThe app backend processes data in a secure manner, ensuring that\\ninappropriate access is restricted at all times. The following sections\\nspeak to the various data sent by the app to the app backend.\\n\\nDiagnosis Keys -- a request for Diagnosis Keys is triggered by the\\nmanual contact tracing operations based on a positive test result as\\npart of COVID-19 core clinical pathway. The lab test centre in BSO will\\nsecurely send the phone number from positive tests only to the app\\nbackend SMS solution. The SMS solution will request a 6 digit code for\\ninput from the app backend. The SMS service (a backend application\\nhosted on the AWS account) will send an SMS message with the code to the\\nphone. The app backend retains the code and this is stored for\\nverification, in app backend, along with the date. The phone number and\\nSMS is removed from the SMS solution at this stage. The code and date is\\nretained for a maximum of 30 minutes.\\n\\nThe app user receives an authorisation code (following a positive test\\nresult), entering it in app UI and consents to upload diagnosis keys.\\nThe app then calls an app backend API using an HTTPS POST with the\\nDiagnosis Keys and the code. The app backend ensures a code match, and\\nuses the date information to store the appropriate Diagnosis Keys in the\\nDiagnosis Key Registry. The code and date information is deleted from\\nthe app backend at this stage. A Web Application Firewall is used to\\nmonitor across all API services in particular the diagnosis key upload\\nAPI for malicious activity.\\n\\nApp indicators and metrics -- this data once received by the app backend\\nis transmitted securely to the DoH using a PKI-based sFTP from AWS to\\nthe CSO on a daily basis. The data is encrypted with the CSO Public Key.\\nThe data is retained by DoH for 24 hours from the day of receipt in case\\nin order to facilitate the transfer of the data to the HSCB. The data\\ncan be accessed by DoH / HSCB operations staff in appropriate roles.\\nThese roles are authorised by the DoH CDIO. Audit logs of access are\\ncaptured and reviewed for compliance by BSO IT Security.\\n\\nIP address and security tokens -- as mentioned previously and noting\\nhere for completeness, IP addresses are processed in the app backend at\\nthe networking layer and no further for the purposes of networking and\\nnetwork security only. The IP address is not logged on any service by\\nthe app backend. Also, as mentioned security tokens are created to\\nprotect the app backend from malicious actors. The first connection of\\nan app to the app backend contains security measures such as ensuring\\nthe device is valid and not an emulator or a bot. This establishes the\\nmeans of validating subsequent traffic from the app over its lifetime.\\n\\n### Exercise of Data Subject Rights\\n\\nUsers have rights under GDPR when their personal data are processed by\\ndata controllers. The following considerations should be noted. IP\\naddresses are not retained on the app backend, but for transient network\\nrouting and network security purposes. Diagnosis keys are not capable of\\nbeing associated with a person as they are non-identifying by design.\\nData subjects can exercise their rights under the contact tracing\\noperation processes.[^6]\\n\\nRight to information -- a Data Protection Privacy Notice (Notice) is\\nprovided in the app itself on those pages which request information and\\nalso in the app Settings. The Notice contains information as prescribed\\nunder Article 13 and 14 of the GDPR.\\n\\nRight to rectification -- the user has a right to have inaccurate\\npersonal data rectified and can make requests to have their data\\nrectified to the DOH for data not processed on the phone, and can update\\ndata via settings on the app as set out in this document.\\n\\nRight of access -- since no personal data is retained, it would not be\\npossible for the DoH to comply with this aspect of GDPR.\\n\\nRight to erasure -- the user can select the Leave function, delete the\\napp at any time, and delete ENS data via device settings -- erasing all\\ndata processed on the phone. Further deletion requests can be sent to\\nthe DOH.\\n\\nRight to restriction -- the user can revoke their ENS permission, revoke\\ntheir exposure notification permission and decide not to upload keys.\\nUltimately the user can decide to Leave and/or delete the App from their\\ndevice.\\n\\nRight to portability -- it is not possible for users to port their keys,\\nfor example, from one device to another device as the user does not have\\naccess to such keys on their device (save to delete them) and as regards\\nthose uploaded to the DoH, the DoH cannot identify which keys belong to\\nwhich user.\\n\\nRight to object -- the user can use the Leave function to delete the\\ninformation from the app; the user can delete the app from their device\\nand the user can delete ENS data via device settings.\\n\\nRight not to be subject to solely automated decision-making including\\nprofiling -- if the ENS detects a match between a Rolling Proximity\\nIdentifier on the App and a Diagnosis Key downloaded from DoH Diagnosis\\nKey Registry, a decision is made that a close contact has taken place.\\nThis decision is based solely on the automated processing of identifiers\\nand keys and does significantly affect users. However, this processing\\nis based on the consent of the user, when they enabled the service on\\ntheir phone.\\n\\n### International Transfers\\n\\nThere will be no international transfers of data. The AWS account is\\nhosted in London region. The BSO servers infrastructure is hosted in\\nBelfast. The backend integration with the ROI to support\\ninteroperability is hosted within the EU and is GDPR compliant. It\\nappears likely that Germany will host a federated server for Europe to\\nsupport European interoperability. Once this becomes available, the\\nbackend infrastructure on AWS will be linked to this server to support\\npan European interoperability.\\n\\n### Appointment of Data Processors\\n\\nAll of the data processors are appointed under Data Processors\\nAgreements in compliance with Article 28 of the GDPR.\\n\\n### Compliance with approved codes of conduct \\n\\nArticle 35 (8) of the GDPR provides that in assessing the impact of\\nprocessing operations, due account should be taken as regards compliance\\nwith approved codes of conduct. Since early April, both the European\\nCommission and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) have issued\\ndocumentation on the use of mobile apps for the fight against the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic that are relevant for the purpose of this DPIA.\\n\\nThe European Commission issued a recommendation on the 8 April 2020 on a\\ncommon Union toolbox for the use of technology and data to combat and\\nexit from the COVID-19 crisis. The eHealth Network issued\\nrecommendations for a common approach to mobile tracing apps. The app\\nhas been assessed against these recommendations and it complies with all\\nrecommendations set out.\\n\\nThe EDPB issued Guidelines 04/2020 on the use of location data and\\ncontact tracing tools in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak.[^7] While\\nthe guidance is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and the purpose is\\nto provide general guidance, the app was assessed against the\\nrecommendations and obligations outlined in the documents. The app\\ncomplies with conditions set out therein. The App is a COVID-19 pandemic\\nresponse app, one that only performs contact tracing. The clear\\nalignment of purposes of the app functions with respect to the response\\nto the pandemic.\\n\\nThe detailed assessment of the app against the above guidelines are to\\nbe published online.[^8]\\n\\nIdentify and Assess Risks\\n-------------------------\\n\\nAppendix E sets out the risks that have been identified for the project\\nand the levels for those risks *if not mitigated*. Overall risk score\\nfor each risk identified is calculated as the product of the risk\\nlikelihood score and the risk impact score (i.e. likelihood score X\\nimpact score). The following sets out the metrics used in documenting\\nthe risk assessment.\\n\\nIdentify Measures to Reduce Risks\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nAn evaluation of the identified risks in the previous section has been\\ncarried out and a series of measures have been detailed that seek to\\nmitigate those risks to an acceptable level. The table in Appendix F\\nsets out these mitigation measures and an assessment of the risk impact\\ndue to their introduction. The table also sets out if these mitigation\\nmeasures have been approved.\\n\\n"}}');
